# PhotoFit
This package allows you to calculate and visualize the evolution in time of the effective radius, temperature and luminosity of a supernova from multiple-bands photometric light-curves.

## Documenation

`PhotoFit` is a package to model the effective radius and temperature from multiple-bands photometry of a supernova.

### How does PhotoFit work?

1. Measurements in different bands are usually taken at different epochs. The first task completed by `PhotoFit` is to interpolate the flux and (more tricky) the errors on
common epochs defined by the user. `PhotoFit` does this task using Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) simulations. This first step can be time-consuming (~0.5 min per band and per epoch),
but you can set the parameters (in the parameters file `params.py`) to only do this once for a given data set.
At the end of this first step, there is one spectral energy distribution (SED) to fit per epoch.

2. `PhotoFit` then fits each SED with a blackbody model that has been corrected for:
    - the extinction: `PhotoFit` does this using Schlay & Finkbeiner (2011) and using the extinction curves of Cardelli et al. (1989).
    - the redshift
    - the effect of the filters transmission curves: `PhotoFit` does this using the `pyphot` package for synthetic photometry.

3. The fit itself can be done in two different ways (to be chosen by the user and defined in the `params.py` file):
    - Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulations (with emcee). The advantage of this option is it gives you error bars on T and R. The disadvantage is that it is time-consuming
(~30 min per epoch for 100 walkers and 350 steps )
    - A linear fit with a grid of temperatures. The advantage of this method is its speed. The disadvantage is the lack of error bars.

## How to install the `PhotoFit` code?

### pip

`pip install PhotoFit`

### Python version
* `python 2`: higher than `2.7.10`
* `python 3`

### Required python packages
* `math`
* `numpy`
* `pylab`
* `emcee`
* `matplotlib`
* `pyphot`

## How to run the `PhotoFit` code?

### Edit the params.py file

After every modification of `params.py`, rerun

```python
>>> python setup.py install
```
from your `PhotoFit` directory

### Calculate the evolution of R and T

The simplest way to run PhotoFit is
```python
>>> import PhotoFit
>>> Best=PhotoFit.calculate_T_and_R_in_time()
```
`Best` is a numpy array where the first column is the time (jd), the second column is the temperature (K) and the third column is the radius (cm).

By default, the code show and save the plots. If you do not want to see and save these plots, you can set `show_underlying_plots` to `False`, i.e. run

```python
>>> Best=PhotoFit.calculate_T_and_R_in_time(show_underlying_plots=False)
```
And if you want the code to tell you more about what it is doing at each step, you can set `verbose` to `True`:

```python
>>> Best=PhotoFit.calculate_T_and_R_in_time(verbose=True)
```
The `Best` numpy array is stored in your output directory (defined in the `params.py` file), in a file called `Results.txt`. In addition to this file, the code creates one sub-directory per epoch, with several files and plots in it.

  <img src="./test/result_fit_sed_mat/day_1.359/fit_result_FLux.pdf" width="350",raw=True>
</p>

The results of the interpolation (see step 1. of [How does PhotoFit work](https://github.com/maayane/PhotoFit/blob/master/README.md#how-does-photofit-work)) are shown in a directory defined in your `params.py` file.
